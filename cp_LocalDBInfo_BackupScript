INIT - Specifies that all backup sets should be overwritten, but preserves the media header. If INIT is specified, any existing backup set on that device is overwritten, if conditions permit.
SKIP(With Init) - If the volume contains a valid2 media header, overwrites any backup sets on the media, preserving only the media header.
NOFORMAT - Specifies that the backup operation preserves the existing media header and backup sets on the media volumes used for this backup operation. This is the default behavior.
REWIND - Specifies that SQL Server releases and rewinds the tape. REWIND is the default.
NOUNLOAD - Specifies that after the BACKUP operation the tape remains loaded on the tape drive.
COMPRESSION - Explicitly enables backup compression.
STATS - Displays a message each time another percentage completes
